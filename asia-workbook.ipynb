The GII can be used for international comparisons, but the global GII’s chosen indicators are deeply affected by data limitations.\n",

    "The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions—reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. It ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The 3 Dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Reproductive Health\n",
    "Measured by 2 indicators: the maternal mortality ratio and the adolescent fertility rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators are used because the degree to which a society prioritizes the well-being of women during childbirth is intrinsically important, and is also a clear signal of women’s status in society. In many countries around the world, the risk of death in childbirth could be significantly reduced through the provision of basic education, contraceptives, antenatal health services and skilled birth attendance. Adolescent childbearing tends to prevent young women from achieving higher levels of education, which is necessary for success in the labour market and accessing other life opportunities. Early childbirth also poses significant health risks for the mother and her baby. Some studies suggest that because their bodies are not yet fully developed, teenage mothers’ risk of death in childbirth is five times higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Empowerment\n",
    "Measured by two indicators: the share of parliamentary seats held by each sex, and secondary and higher education attainment levels (percentages of men and women, 25 years and above, who have at least a secondary education).\n",
    "\n",
    "Women have traditionally been disadvantaged in the political arena at all levels of government. Estimates for parliamentary representation at the national level reflect women’s visibility in political leadership and society more generally, and the extent to which women hold high offices. In turn, higher levels of educational attainment expand women’s freedoms by strengthening their capacity to question, reflect and act, and also to access information. Educated women are more likely to enjoy meaningful work, to use their voices in public debate, to be able to care for their own health and that of their family, and to act as agents throughout society. Secondary and higher educational attainment are used because disparities in these levels strongly affect women’s career and leadership prospects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Labor\n",
    "Measured by labor force participation rate in males and females, which is the percentage of individuals of each gender who work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Women may not participate in the labour market for several reasons, including exclusion, unequal pay and incentives, household duties or caring for relatives, and pregnancy and childcare. Thus, the level of women’s participation reflects several aspects, including possibilities and permission to work, which in turn includes labour market opportunities, and the capability of women to combine productive work with duties of care and reproductive responsibilities. Clearly this is affected also by men’s complementary activities in the household."

An inverse of a number is equal to one divided by that number. An inverse of a number decreases as the number increases. Given that a higher value of the MMR or the AFR indicates a worse health outcome, the inverses of both indicators are used while constructing the GII. The rest of the three indicators, share of parliamentary seats held (PR), attainment at secondary and higher education (SE) and labour market participation rate (LFPR), are already available in percentage terms, and thus are automatically normalized between zero and hundred."

    "\n",
    "The GII’s use of reproductive health indicators has been quentioned. Naturally, data for the two indicators are only available for women, making interpretations of the GII problematic. The GII responds to this discrepancy by giving men a value of “one” in this dimension—a value which signifies that men have achieved the best possible outcome here. However, a measure of inequality must consist of measurable achievements for all the groups involved. The two indicators—maternal mortality ratio and adolescent fertility rate—should instead, it is said, be used to construct an index that compares the state of women across countries, rather than a gender inequality index, comparing the situation between women and men.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the value of the GII doesn’t tell us which gender is doing better or worse. Instead the GII score tells us the level of inequality between two groups—men and women—but not which group is disadvantaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, several other gender indices are used by different world institutions, such as the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index (GGI), the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Women’s Economic Opportunity Index (WEOI), the OECD’s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI), and the Gender Equity Index (GEI) developed by Social Watch. They differ from the GII in many ways yet can be useful complements as we seek to understand the underlying causes of gender inequalities in economic participation."
