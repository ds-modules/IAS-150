    "Gender equity is an essential and widely recognized international policy goal because of its intrinsic and instrumental value. It is clearly important as an end in itself and also is a means to the attainment of other development goals such as the nourishment and educational achievements of children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global Gender Inequality Index (GII) — built on the same framework as the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) — was released in 2010. It measures inequalities in achievements between women and men across three dimensions of human development: reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market. The GII can be used for international comparisons (the global GII), as presented in the 2010 Human Development Report (HDR). Like the HDI, the global GII’s chosen indicators are deeply affected by data limitations, but more accurate national GIIs can be developed using richer data sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions—reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. It ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GII is computed using the association-sensitive inequality measure suggested by Seth (2009), which implies that the index is based on the general mean of general means of different orders — the first aggregation is by a geometric mean across dimensions; these means, calculated separately for women and men, are then aggregated using a harmonic mean across genders.\n"

    "The reproductive health dimension is measured by two indicators: the maternal mortality ratio and the adolescent fertility rate. These indicators are used because the degree to which a society prioritizes the well-being of women during childbirth is intrinsically important, and is also a clear signal of women’s status in society. In many countries around the world, the risk of death in childbirth could be significantly reduced through the provision of basic education, contraceptives, antenatal health services and skilled birth attendance. Adolescent childbearing tends to prevent young women from achieving higher levels of education, which is necessary for success in the labour market and accessing other life opportunities. Early childbirth also poses significant health risks for the mother and her baby. Some studies suggest that because their bodies are not yet fully developed, teenage mothers’ risk of death in childbirth is five times higher."

    "The empowerment dimension is also measured by two indicators: the share of parliamentary seats held by each sex, and the percentages of men and women who are 25 years and above and have secondary or higher levels of educational attainment. Women have traditionally been disadvantaged in the political arena at all levels of government. Estimates for parliamentary representation at the national level reflect women’s visibility in political leadership and society more generally, and the extent to which women hold high offices. In turn, higher levels of educational attainment expand women’s freedoms by strengthening their capacity to question, reflect and act, and also to access information. Educated women are more likely to enjoy meaningful work, to use their voices in public debate, to be able to care for their own health and that of their family, and to act as agents throughout society. We use secondary and higher educational attainment because disparities in these levels strongly affect women’s career and leadership prospects. "

Thus, the level of women’s participation reflects several aspects, including possibilities and permission to work, which in turn includes labour market opportunities, and the capability of women to combine productive work with duties of care and reproductive responsibilities.

For both of the women’s reproductive health indicators - the maternal mortality rate (MMR) and the average fertility rate (AFR) - an inverse of each indicator is taken.

The rest of the three indicators, share of parliamentary seats held (PR), attainment at secondary and higher education (SE) and labour market participation rate (LFPR), are already available in percentage terms, and thus are automatically normalized between zero and hundred. \n",

    "The GII is designed to capture the inequality in achievements across genders using three important dimensions of human development. It is assumed that, for a country, the maximum ideal human development is achieved for a given set of achievements whenever they are equally distributed across genders. The GII of a country is interpreted therefore as the loss in human development due to the unequal distribution in the GII achievements between men and women as a percentage of the maximum ideal human development. This interpretation of the GII is analogous to the interpretation of the IHDI. However, note that since the GII is based on three different dimensions than those used for the HDI, it cannot be interpreted as the loss in HDI due to gender inequality."

    "As stated above, the GII can be used for international comparisons (the global GII) or adapted for regional or national level exercises, in a similar way to other well-being, inequality or poverty measures. Both global and national level exercises are extremely valuable in obtaining different—but complementary—information.  \n",
    "The global GII has been designed for international comparability and thus its dimensions and indicators are fixed across countries. This is useful because it enables comparison between genders in a country vis-à-vis the rest of the world. This provides policy-relevant information for both national governments and the international community. However it does have two limitations that can be addressed through the construction of national GIIs. First, the global GII is shaped by data constraints—which continue to be shockingly pervasive despite the central importance of understanding gender disparities. There are other vitally important dimensions of gender disparity that have not been included only because valid, reliable and timely internationally comparable data are lacking. Second, the global GII is comparable but gender discrimination is context specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations can be overcome (at least partially) by creating national GIIs. National exercises are not affected by the limitations imposed by international comparability and thus can incorporate different or additional dimensions and/or indicators (providing the data are available) that are particularly relevant to their country specific context.  \n",
    "The straightforward formula of the GII makes it easy to adapt as the functional form underpinning the index can incorporate more indicators and dimensions, so long as the steps elaborated above are followed precisely.  \n",
    "Potential indicators include: \n",
    "\n",

    "- malnutrition\n",
    "- asset ownership\n",
    "- control over productive resources\n",
    "- gender-based violence\n",

    "\n",
    "The GII’s use of reproductive health indicators has been quentioned. Naturally, data for the two indicators are only available for women, making interpretations of the GII problematic. The GII responds to this discrepancy by giving men a value of “one” in this dimension—a value which signifies that men have achieved the best possible outcome here. However, a measure of inequality must consist of measurable achievements for all the groups involved. The two indicators—maternal mortality ratio and adolescent fertility rate—should instead, it is said, be used to construct an index that compares the state of women across countries, rather than a gender inequality index, comparing the situation between women and men. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the value of the GII doesn’t tell us which gender is doing better or worse. Instead the GII score tells us the level of inequality between two groups—men and women—but not which group is disadvantaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, several other gender indices are used by different world institutions, such as the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index (GGI), the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Women’s Economic Opportunity Index (WEOI), the OECD’s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI), and the Gender Equity Index (GEI) developed by Social Watch. They differ from the GII in many ways yet can be useful complements as we seek to understand the underlying causes of gender inequalities in economic participation. "
