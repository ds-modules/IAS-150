We will be examining the subset of countries in Asia with complete data. We will be comparing the Gender Inequality Index from the 2016 UN Human Development Report with the 2016 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report.\n",

    "The global Gender Inequality Index (GII) was first released in 2010. It measures inequalities in achievements between women and men across three dimensions of human development: reproductive health, empowerment and labour market. The GII can be used for international comparisons, but the global GII’s chosen indicators are deeply affected by data limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GII is computed using the five different indicators describing the three dimensions of human development. The indicators are as follows: maternal mortality rate (MMR), the average fertility rate (AFR), share of parliamentary seats held (PR), attainment at secondary and higher education (SE) and labour force participation rate (LFPR).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move along, we'll see how the global GII provides insights into gender disparities in reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market in Asian countries. It can enable governments, organizations, and individuals to better understand and promote gender equality. The GII can be used to raise awareness of disparities, track progress towards gender equity, and support public action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll compare what we found in the Gender Inequality Index with information from the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. We won't be calculating the Global Gender Gap Index, but will instead just compare the calculation and measurements with those of the GII."

    "\n",
    "The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions—reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. It ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The 3 Dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Reproductive Health\n",
    "Measured by 2 indicators: the maternal mortality ratio and the adolescent fertility rate. Maternal mortality ratio is calculated as the deaths per 100,000 live births, and adolescent fertility rate looks at births per 1,000 women ages 15-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators are used because the degree to which a society prioritizes the well-being of women during childbirth is intrinsically important, and is also a clear signal of women’s status in society. In many countries around the world, the risk of death in childbirth could be significantly reduced through the provision of basic education, contraceptives, antenatal health services and skilled birth attendance. Adolescent childbearing tends to prevent young women from achieving higher levels of education, which is necessary for success in the labour market and accessing other life opportunities. Early childbirth also poses significant health risks for the mother and her baby. Some studies suggest that because their bodies are not yet fully developed, teenage mothers’ risk of death in childbirth is five times higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Empowerment\n",
    "Measured by two indicators: the share of parliamentary seats held by each sex, and secondary and higher education attainment levels (percentages of men and women, 25 years and above, who have at least a secondary education).\n",
    "\n",
    "Women have traditionally been disadvantaged in the political arena at all levels of government. Estimates for parliamentary representation at the national level reflect women’s visibility in political leadership and society more generally, and the extent to which women hold high offices. In turn, higher levels of educational attainment expand women’s freedoms by strengthening their capacity to question, reflect and act, and also to access information. Educated women are more likely to enjoy meaningful work, to use their voices in public debate, to be able to care for their own health and that of their family, and to act as agents throughout society. Secondary and higher educational attainment are used because disparities in these levels strongly affect women’s career and leadership prospects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Labor\n",
    "Measured by labor force participation rate in males and females, which is the percentage of individuals of each gender who work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Women may not participate in the labour market for several reasons, including exclusion, unequal pay and incentives, household duties or caring for relatives, and pregnancy and childcare. Thus, the level of women’s participation reflects several aspects, including possibilities and permission to work, which in turn includes labour market opportunities, and the capability of women to combine productive work with duties of care and reproductive responsibilities. Clearly this is affected also by men’s complementary activities in the household."
